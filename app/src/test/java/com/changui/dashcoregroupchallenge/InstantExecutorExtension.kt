/**
 * One of the interesting problems LiveData solves is to ensure the observer is always
 * called on the main thread.
 * JVM unit tests donâ€™t know anything about the Android main thread!
 * Hence all unit test are executed on a random (background) thread.
 * So to ensure our classes under tests who observe data changes (via livedata.setValue() or livedata.value)
 * are well-managed we need to define a rule in our unit tests
 * In JUnit 5, the concept of Rule and TestRunner are merged into one single concept of Extensions
 * This basically does two things:
 * 1- set a delegate before each test that updates live data values immediately on the calling thread
 * 2- remove the delegate after each tests to avoid influencing other tests.
